UFWI.processors.acceptance_mask
======================================

Create and store a boolean acceptance mask excluding receivers that violate a
±Δ element index around each transmitter.

class AcceptanceMask(BaseProcessor):
    """
    Compute and store a per-transmitter boolean mask that excludes nearby receivers.

    For each transmitter index `tx` (0 ≤ tx < N), receivers whose circular index
    distance to `tx` is ≤ `delta` are marked False; all others are True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta : int
        Radius of exclusion around each transmitter, in element‐index units.
        Receivers with circular distance ≤ delta will be masked out.
        Must be non‐negative. (Default: 63)

    After calling, the following entry is added to `data.ctx`:

    - `data.ctx["elem_mask"]` : ndarray of bool, shape (N, N)
        `elem_mask[tx, rx] == True` indicates receiver `rx` is kept for transmitter `tx`.
        `False` indicates it is excluded.

    Notes
    -----
    - The “circular index distance” between `tx` and `rx` is computed modulo N:

      distance = min((rx−tx) mod N, (tx−rx) mod N)

    - This mask can be used to zero out or skip channels too close to the active element.
